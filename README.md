# Halloween Game 2023

Making a "Luigi's Mansion" inspired Halloween Game in `Babylon.js`

Collect candy from the furniture in a series of procedurally generated haunted mansions, and escape before time run out and the ghosts catch you!

Pick a new random seed to play a different set of levels! Compete for better scores on the same random seed with your friends!
